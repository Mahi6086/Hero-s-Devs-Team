# Getting Started with Project Management Team Selector

This project was bootstrapped with [Project Management Team Selector](https://assignment-08-projects.netlify.app/).

## About This Project

This is a project where you can find world class freelancer programmers. You can hire them for you rown project. You are given a budget. You are to find a combination of programmers to finish your projects. You will try to keep the budget under the given default budget. This was an assignment project given to me as a test by Programming Hero Team.

## Features Of This Project

The used Api was entirely created by me. The data here are collected from programming hero facebook group and the moderstors profile.
The cart will update dynamically if you wanted hire one or multiple programmers. The Team members, their numbers and the budget will update itself dynamically.
This is completely responsive. As it was styled with bootstrap.
This site was deployed on Netlify. The link is provided in the top.
The only bug of this site is that you can hire a single programmer multiple times in a single project. That is unrealistic.

## Used Resouces

In the project, we used:
This was my first offical project on React.
I used Bootstrap to style the whole project. Not even a single line of Pure CSS was used in this project!
<!-- ## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
